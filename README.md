# Copy as Markdown

A simple chrome extension which can copy the selected HTML as Markdown to clipboard. Can copy any web page, and it doubles as a LLM/GPT chat log exporter.

It works on desktop but also on Chrome for Android based browsers that support extensions (eg, Edge Canary).

## Install

* [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-as-markdown/pcmnmggfchmeohmflkfocnkackgcnlln?authuser=0&hl=en)

* Or download the latest developer release in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lrq3000/copy-as-markdown/releases/) page. Then, to install, enable debug mode in Chrome and download the attached zip, unzip it anywhere, and load it in Chrome as an unpackaged extension by pointing to the unzipped folder (otherwise, even signed CRX files that are not hosted on the Chrome WebStore are now disabled forcefully since Chrome forcefully migrated to MV3 in 2025).

## Usage

1. Click `Copy as Markdown` icon in the toolbar.

2. Click the right button and click `Copy as Markdown` menu.

3. Press `Alt+Shift+Y` on Windows or `Option+Shift+Y` on Mac.

## Build

* to build, use `npm run build`

* To make a crx, use:

```
npm install -g crx3
crx3 dist/ --private-key my-extension.pem
```

The private key can be left out for testing purposes, one will then be autogenerated.
