# Copy as Markdown MV3

A simple chrome extension which can copy the selected HTML as Markdown to clipboard, including hypertext links. Can copy any web page's content, and it doubles as a LLM/GPT chat log exporter.

Usage is simple: select some (structured) text, then simply tap the extension's icon, or right-click and click the menu item, a nice infobox will temporarily pop up at the bottom to confirm the copy worked. A lot of formatting styles and HTML structures can be converted and copied to markdown: bold, italics, links, tables, etc.

It works on desktop, and it is the only copy as markdown extension that also works on mobile, on Chrome for Android based browsers that support extensions (eg, [Mises](https://github.com/mises-id/mises-browser-core), Kiwi, Edge Canary, Quetta, Lemur).

This is a fork of [sjmyuan's](https://github.com/sjmyuan/copy-as-markdown) extension ported to Manifest V3.

## Install

* [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-as-markdown/mpaeaaeinmaondpmbigdnpcooahoncfc)

* Or download the latest developer release in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lrq3000/copy-as-markdown/releases/) page. Then, to install, enable debug mode in Chrome and download the attached zip, unzip it anywhere, and load it in Chrome as an unpackaged extension by pointing to the unzipped folder (otherwise, even signed CRX files that are not hosted on the Chrome WebStore are now disabled forcefully since Chrome forcefully migrated to MV3 in 2025).

## Usage

1. Click `Copy as Markdown` icon in the toolbar.

2. Click the right button and click `Copy as Markdown` menu.

3. Press `Alt+Shift+Y` on Windows or `Option+Shift+Y` on Mac.

Can copy content from most LLM/GPT interfaces, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Open WebUI outputs.

It can also be used as a web clipper, especially when combined with a Markdown editor such as [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor) on Android or [Typora](https://typora.io/) on desktop OSes.

## Build

* to build, use `npm run build`

* To make a crx, use:

```
npm install -g crx3
crx3 dist/ --zip --private-key my-extension.pem
```

The private key can be left out for testing purposes, one will then be autogenerated.

## Known issues

* Since the migration to MV3 (but maybe it also happened before), copying sometimes fails, usually at the first tap, but then subsequent taps work fine. This issue happens randomly, and I could not find a way to fix it. Anyway the workaround is easy: if you copy but the infobox does not pop up at the bottom, the copy did not work, so simply retap the extension's icon to redo the copy, then it should work this time. If anybody has an idea how to fix this, please do a PR or open an issue to suggest how to fix that!
